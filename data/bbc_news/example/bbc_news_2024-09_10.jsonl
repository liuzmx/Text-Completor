{"title":"Post Office handles record amount of cash - BBC News","published_date":"2024-09-01","authors":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bbcnews","description":"The increasing use of the Post Office to handle cash comes as bank branch closures continue.","section":"Business","content":"Barton-upon-Humber Post Office is one of 11,500 branches helping customers with access to cash\n\nThe Post Office handled a record amount of cash in July with customers either depositing or withdrawing more than \u00a33.7bn. July's record beat previous highs set in May, April and December. The increasing use of the Post Office to handle cash comes as the rate of closure of bank branches shows no sign of slowing. More than 6,000 have shut their doors since 2015, an average of about 50 each month.\n\nBanking hubs are slowly being opened to try to offer the public similar services. There are around 70 already in operation with 100 expected to have opened their doors by Christmas. They aim to provide access to cash for those who need it, and to allow small businesses to deposit takings. But with hubs and post offices unable to provide much more than the basic banking services, the closure of branches is likely to remain contentious for a long time to come.\n\nMairi Wingate says a lot of her customers say cash helps them budget better\n\nMairi Wingate has been the postmistress in Barton-upon-Humber for 19 years and says there are lots of reasons people prefer cash. \"Well it can range from anything from people wanting \u00a310 to go to the local hairdressers to go and get their hair done ranging up to \u00a3300 or \u00a3400 and it's just budgeting for the weekly shopping and bills. \"They know exactly what they've got and they can't overspend what they haven't got.\" The Post Office's reputation has been seriously damaged in recent years because of the Horizon IT scandal which saw hundreds of postmasters and mistress wrongly convicted of stealing money. During that time however daily visits to Post Office branches have remained relatively stable at around 10 million each week, and its position on the High Street means it offers a local alternative to many people when bank branches shut down.\n\n\"Cash is king\" according to John, who rarely uses his cards\n\nJohn calls into the Post Office nearly every week to withdraw cash from his bank account. \"\u00a350 I've taken out to go shopping with, like I have done for the last 50 years. Cash is still king in my book. \"I do have cards but very rarely use them. You can flash a card around without really knowing what you're doing,\" he says. \"Cash in the pocket [though] you know where you are.\"","link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/articles\/c36nrw02yy5o","top_image":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/ace\/standard\/2048\/cpsprodpb\/90c0\/live\/a1be6280-6778-11ef-b970-9f202720b57a.jpg"}

{"title":"Keir Starmer 'doom and gloom' may go too far, some Labour MPs fear - BBC News","published_date":"2024-09-01","authors":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bbcnews","description":"Some Labour MPs are calling for a positive message from the government as Parliament returns from recess.","section":"Politics","content":"After Starmer's 'gloom', Labour MPs want some cheer\n\nThe prime minister has spent the summer preparing the ground for unpopular and controversial spending and taxation decisions. He wants to persuade voters not to blame him, but the governments who came before. The Conservatives, he argues, left the country\u2019s finances in such a mess that there\u2019s going to be some pain in fixing them. The message has been bleak \u2013 deliberately so. Ministers want to let the public know the next few months are not going to be a walk in the park. The government hasn\u2019t ruled out increasing capital gains tax, inheritance tax and fuel duty in October\u2019s Budget, arguing that difficult decisions are needed to \"fix the foundations\" of the British economy. But might No 10 be going too far? Privately, some Labour MPs think so. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too doom and gloom,\u201d said one, calling for more of a focus on the positive message the government has to sell. Another agreed, contrasting the enthusiasm and energy of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago (attended by several senior Labour figures) and the hard truths message from Sir Keir in the Downing Street garden a few days later. The razzmatazz versus the gloom.\n\nThere are some signs ministers might be thinking the same. In the next fortnight, the chancellor will focus more on Labour\u2019s promises to grow the economy. Ministers are promising \u201cthe most packed legislative agenda in decades\u201d to deliver changes to the housing market, energy market, railways and more. There will also be a bill on \"budget responsibility\" \u2013 which will mean the government\u2019s forecasters have to assess every major financial announcement in future.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves could raise some taxes in the upcoming Budget\n\nBut one decision in particular is proving controversial already: removing Winter Fuel Payments for millions of pensioners not on pension credit. It\u2019s a warning sign for the government that they can blame others for the need to make tough decisions \u2013 but they will ultimately have to deal with any opposition to the decisions they make. The backlash has grown over the summer break, with charities and opposition parties leading the charge. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats want a vote on the change and a growing number of Labour MPs are privately worried about the decision and its political impact. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group for Ageing and Older People, told me: \"This is not going to go away \u2013 the government cannot run away from it.\" There is an acceptance that a universal payment for all pensioners \u2013 including wealthy people \u2013 is hard to justify. The government is planning another campaign to encourage people who are eligible to sign up for pension credit as soon as possible. But several Labour MPs I spoke to this week expected some mitigations to be announced in the coming weeks for those who are just above the pension credit threshold but still struggling. Ideas being floated include support to people on certain council tax bands, as suggested by the personal finance expert Martin Lewis. At the moment the Treasury isn\u2019t budging. The chancellor writes today: \u201cI know these are tough choices, especially on winter fuel. They were not the choices I wanted to make or expected to make, but they were the right choices to put our country on a firmer footing. Because by taking the tough decisions now to protect the public finances, we can begin the process of change.\u201d Some Labour MPs have been frustrated by a perceived lack of engagement from the department on the backlash they are seeing in their email inbox. The only hint at the moment is that councils in England will get cash to help people with the cost of living this winter \u2013 when the Household Support Fund is likely extended.\n\nLet\u2019s be really clear: these nerves in the Labour ranks are far less significant than the regicidal rebellions we\u2019ve seen over the past few years among Conservative MPs. Sir Keir has a thumping majority and can largely do what he wants in Parliament. The decision to remove the whip from seven MPs after the first rebellion \u2013 on the two-child cap for some benefits \u2013 has reduced the likelihood of another one over this issue. The government also wants to announce the hard stuff now so that it feels like a distant memory by the time of the election. But that strategy isn\u2019t without risks. The Conservatives, despite being a massively depleted force in Parliament, have landed some blows over the summer. They\u2019ve accused the government of prioritising pay deals over benefits for pensioners. There have also been several accusations of cronyism after people with links to the Labour party were given civil service jobs. The risk for Sir Keir isn\u2019t that his party turns against him but that some of these accusations start to stick. Labour is doing everything it can to shape the political narrative for the coming months by arguing it has a big mess to clear up. But plenty of others will be trying to do the same, arguing that Labour is going too far or is exaggerating the problems with its economic inheritance. Remember, there are choices involved in everything the government is doing. It is a choice to rule out putting up major taxes that would raise more money. It is a choice to rule out more borrowing. And it is a choice to focus spending on pay deals rather than winter fuel payments. It is up to ministers to persuade you they are making the right choices. There are plenty of other challenges around the corner for the government too. How to stop small boats crossing the channel. How to reduce NHS waiting lists. How to balance the needs of businesses and unions when new workers' rights legislation is passed. Fixing problems in the court and prison systems. I\u2019m sure most people reading this would have something else to add to the list. It won\u2019t be an easy few months for the new government. But some in Labour ranks are hoping they can do more to balance the gloom \u2013 with some optimism.","link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/articles\/c4gvdz28pelo","top_image":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/ace\/standard\/3840\/cpsprodpb\/44ad\/live\/d8c23ed0-67f2-11ef-bacc-1d023698ad42.jpg"}
{"title":"Oasis tickets: Hundreds lodge complaints over dynamic pricing - BBC News","published_date":"2024-09-01","authors":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bbcnews","description":"The UK advertising watchdog gets 450 complaints, as the government pledges to look at dynamic pricing.","section":"Culture","content":"Hundreds of Oasis fans have made official complaints about how tickets for the band's reunion tour were advertised, as the government pledged to look into the use of \"dynamic pricing\". The system led the prices for many tickets to shoot up by more than \u00a3200 during the day after they went on sale on Saturday, leaving some fans out of pocket and others forced to give up. Ministers have now said they will include dynamic pricing in a consultation into ticket resale websites, which had already been announced by the government and will start in the autumn. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"there are a number of things that we can\" and \"should do\".\n\n\"Because otherwise you get to the situation where families simply can't go or are absolutely spending a fortune on tickets,\" he said. He added the government would be consulting on the future of the law, which \"may well mean adjustments\". \"There are a number of techniques going on here where people are buying a lot of tickets, reselling them at a huge price,\" he said. \"And that's just not fair - it's just pricing people out of the market.\" Before he became prime minister, Sir Keir backed a move to introduce a cap on prices for resold tickets and limits to how many tickets a person can resell. On Sunday, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she wants to end \"rip-off resales\" and ensure tickets are sold \"at fair prices\". On Ticketmaster, the cost of some Oasis tickets rose to more than \u00a3350 - up from \u00a3135 when the sale began on Saturday. Ticketmaster said the prices were set by the \"event organiser\", who \"has priced these tickets according to their market value\". Dynamic pricing is not a new phenomenon and is allowed under consumer protection laws. Some tickets were also quickly listed on resale websites for thousands of pounds. Ms Nandy said it was \"depressing to see vastly inflated prices excluding ordinary fans\" from gigs. Outlining the government review's scope, she said ministers would look at \"issues around the transparency and use of dynamic pricing, including the technology around queuing systems which incentivise it\".\n\nFellow minister Lucy Powell, leader of the House of Commons, was among those hit by dynamic pricing over the weekend. She eventually forked out more than double the original quoted cost of a ticket for an Oasis show. She told BBC Radio 5 Live that she did not \"particularly like\" surge pricing, but that \"it is the market and how it operates\". On Monday, the Advertising Standards Authority said it had received 450 complaints saying the adverts for what tickets would cost and how many were available were misleading. \"We're carefully assessing these complaints and, as such, can't comment any further at this time,\" an ASA spokesperson said. \"To emphasise, we are not currently investigating these ads.\u201d\n\nOne fan, Jamie Moore, told the BBC he had never felt \"so let down by a website\" in his life. Oasis and the band's promoter have not responded to the complaints. However, Twickets, one of the band's official face value resale websites, has announced it has cut its charges after an outcry when screenshots circulated showing it charging more than \u00a3130 in booking fees alone. The company said it had cut its fees from 14% to 10% - with a further 1% on top to cover bank charges - up to a maximum of \u00a325 per ticket for the Oasis shows. Twickets founder Richard Davies said: \"Twickets is a small business and by focusing on resale only doesn\u2019t sell the volume of tickets that the major ticketing agencies do. \"Our booking fee goes towards the costs of running the platform, paying our team and ensuring that Twickets is a viable and sustainable business doing the right thing for fans.\"\n\nSchellion Horn, competition economist at accounting firm Grant Thornton, told the BBC's Today programme that dynamic pricing was about setting the price around supply and demand. That means as demand for tickets goes up, then the price rises to match that. Ms Horn suggested there was a \"realisation that actually the tickets were under priced\" when the sale first started on Saturday, given there was so many people in online queues. People were \"clearly willing to pay prices of \u00a3300-\u00a3400\", she added, otherwise they would not have parted with their money. But she said the problem was people were not aware that dynamic pricing was in operation and so there was a lack of transparency. \"We see it all the time, whether it's Uber or airline tickets or holidays or train tickets, so we're very very used to dynamic pricing... but I think this was the first time we've really seen it for concert tickets in the UK and people just weren't expecting it and I think that's where the issue came in,\" she said. Meanwhile, ticketing websites were praised for coping with the \"enormous demand\" for Oasis tickets by Jonathan Brown, chief executive of the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers, who insisted prices would have been set by the band.\n\u2022 None Oasis ticket sales - everything you need to know about reunion\n\nDid you get Oasis tickets and were affected by 'dynamic pricing'?","link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/articles\/c20r26p7d0ro","top_image":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/ace\/standard\/2048\/cpsprodpb\/b65a\/live\/cbcd1320-68a2-11ef-a465-778257f4468c.jpg"}

However, the Open Book in Wigtown - which has been running for a decade - now has a two-year waiting list. The brainchild of author and filmmaker Jessica Fox, the volunteer-run enterprise lets visitors live the dream of running their own bookshop. In the process, it now also contributes about \u00a310,000-a-year to the Wigtown Festival Company's charitable work. But who comes to stay and run the shop and what draws them to this corner of south-west Scotland?\n\nThe Open Book sits on a corner in the heart of the south of Scotland town\n\nOne of its most recent occupants was humanitarian aid worker Isabella Garcia from Austin, Texas. She stayed for five nights, taking the chance to run the shop for four days. \"I actually found out about the Open Book years ago - I would say maybe even five or more years ago,\" she said. \"I am a book lover so usually every town I go into, every place I visit, one of the first things I look for is a bookshop or a bookshop-coffee shop joined together.\"\n\nIsabella said there was no feeling like selling a book she had put on display\n\nShe read about the spot in rural Galloway when looking for holidays for book lovers. \"I came across an article that talked about this and I thought that was so interesting and especially, back then, there was no place where you could run a bookshop,\" she said. \"I have found recently that there are apparently a few other Airbnbs - but nothing like this one.\" However, while it was relatively easy to find out about the shop, securing a stay was another matter.\n\nThe Open Book has started to generate money for the Wigtown Festival's charitable work\n\n\"It was always booked up every single time,\" said Isabella. \"There was never anything available, not even during Christmas holidays.\" In fact, since it first started taking bookings in August 2014, nearly 450 guests have come to stay. A map on the wall shows where they have come from \u2013 with locations as far apart as Hawaii and Beijing. Isabella put herself on a waiting list to join their number but stumbled across two dates open this year and snapped them up. She said her few days had been a delight - despite coming to Scotland in the dampest of summers.\n\nAnd business turned out to be better than expected. \"I'm actually surprised that we got as many people coming through the shop as we did,\" she said. \"We arrived pretty late - after 18:00 - and the town was empty. She said it was a big contrast to her work on the front-line at crisis points in the likes of Ukraine and Haiti and that the houses in Wigtown had a picture-book look. \"This is a throwback in time,\" she said. \"It's like the good old days, it's a little town, everyone's very friendly, there's only so many places. \"It does make you think about sustainability of towns as well as the environment and conservation of the resources that you're using. \"\n\nIsabella said there was a picture-book quality to the buildings in Wigtown\n\nHer advice to anyone hoping to follow in her footsteps? \"I would say to keep checking because you never know when something will pop up,\" she said. \"Running the bookshop was definitely worth it. \"There's no better feeling than somebody buying a book that you put on display.\" And her own stay more than lived up to expectations. \"I feel like this is a book lover's dream,\" she said. \"It is a small little town, which means that there's not much to do. \"That window seat is absolutely amazing, it's right on the corner and it sees right into the town.\" And with 14 bookshops she said \"you'll never not have something to read\".\n\n\"I could see myself retiring and opening up a bookshop and something similar to this - an independent bookshop in a small town,\" Isabella added. \"I love the fact that it's a lot of small businesses. \"I'm hoping to be able to return here during the book festival and from what I've seen and heard I need to book my accommodation early.\" The festival runs from 27 September to 6 October this year. Even if Isabella does not make it back, she will already have done her bit to help support Scotland's national book town.\n\nWhat stories would you like BBC News to cover from the south of Scotland?","link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/articles\/c5y844905n9o","top_image":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/ace\/standard\/3840\/cpsprodpb\/7c6f\/live\/365a30b0-6736-11ef-a847-f97d4d9e2eff.jpg"}
{"title":"Scottie Scheffler wins Tour Championship from Collin Morikawa at East Lake - BBC Sport","published_date":"2024-09-01","authors":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BBCSport\/","description":"Scottie Scheffler underlines his status as the world's number one golfer with a dominant victory at the season-ending Tour Championship in Atlanta.","section":"Golf","content":"Scheffler won four 'signature' events on the PGA Tour in 2024\n\n-30 S Scheffler (US); -26 C Morikawa (US); -24 S Theegala (US)\n\nScottie Scheffler underlined his status as the world's number one golfer with a dominant victory at the season-ending Tour Championship in Atlanta. It caps a remarkable 2024 for the American who has won an Olympic gold medal, his second Masters and become the first to land successive Players Championship titles. He is the first player since Tiger Woods in 2007 to win seven events in a PGA Tour season. Scheffler, who started the final round with a five-shot lead over Collin Morikawa, shot a four-under 67 to win on 30 under and collect $25m (\u00a319m) of the $100m prize fund. He was four clear of Morikawa, who hit a 66, with another American, Sahith Theegala, in third on 24 under after a 64.\n\nFor a third successive year, Scheffler began the week on 10 under par as the leader of the FedEx Cup standings, two clear of Xander Schauffele in second, with Morikawa among a group on four under in the staggered start. And he stayed ahead through the first three rounds to set up what looked like a straightforward final round. His five-shot lead was six after Morikawa bogeyed the first hole. However, Scheffler made uncharacteristic errors as he recorded successive bogeys on the seventh and eighth holes that allowed Morikawa, who birdied the fourth, sixth and eighth holes, to close to within two. A wayward drive left Scheffler hacking out from underneath a conifer tree down the left of the seventh, while he mis-hit a greenside bunker shot on the eighth that squirted out right and ended up further away from the hole. \"I was a bit frustrated because it was quite a basic shot, but I've shanked it from a similar lie before,\" he said. \"Ted [Scott, Scheffler's caddie] did a good job of helping me reset. He gave me a nice pep talk there on the back of the eighth green because I looked at him like, 'man, I don't know about this, this isn't looking so hot right now'. \"He gave me a little pep talk and then I was able to hit a really nice iron shot in there [on nine] and got things rolling. \"He really is a huge part of the team. I don't know if I'd be able to do any of this without him on my bag. \"And then I did some really nice stuff to finish this tournament off.\" That \"nice stuff\" started on the ninth hole with a birdie, and two more followed on the 10th and 11th as Scheffler surged four clear. Morikawa responded with a birdie on the 13th, but Scheffler drained a 15-foot eagle putt on the next to re-establish his five-shot lead, and he parred his way home to secure his first FedEx Cup title. \"Nothing fazes him,\" said Morikawa, who collected $12.5m for finishing runner-up. \"Whether I was gaining some ground or he was gaining ground, it didn't change how he walked or how he played or how he went through every shot. \"That's something to learn. His mental game is a lot stronger than a lot of people know.\" Sunday's prize money takes Scheffler's official earnings for the season to around $54m and he has broken the PGA Tour record in that respect for a third season in a row. It has also been quite the year off the course for Scheffler, who became a father for the first time in May and then just days later was arrested on the morning of the second round of the US PGA Championship for an alleged traffic offence as he arrived at the course. He was taken to the police station and charged with assaulting a police officer but made it back to the course in time to play. All charges were later dropped. \"I feel like I've lived almost a full lifetime in this one year,\" said Scheffler \"It's been nuts.\" Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy finished the best of the UK golfers. He started the week level with Morikawa on four under and closed with a five-under 66 to end joint ninth on 16 under. Scotland's Robert MacIntyre had six birdies on his back nine as he shot a 64 to end 11 under, one ahead of Tommy Fleetwood who sneaked into the top 20 with a 67. Fleetwood's fellow Englishman Aaron Rai, who won his first PGA Tour title in August, hit a closing 70 for a total of six under.","link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sport\/golf\/articles\/cd6ypq8endpo","top_image":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/ace\/standard\/819\/cpsprodpb\/24cc\/live\/7ab40850-68ab-11ef-8212-81321d7dacd8.jpg"}
