Commandos rappelled from helicopters, planted explosives inside the underground facility, and removed sensitive information. Some reports suggested they even captured individuals, possibly Iranian, working there. Six weeks earlier, Israel assassinated Fuad Shukr, one of Hezbollah’s top military commanders. Nine people were killed after handheld pagers used by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon. A report in the Wall Street Journal said that just before the attack, Shukr received a message asking him to go to his seventh floor apartment, where he was easier to hit. CCTV footage of the pagers going off were broadcast around the world. The images were shocking - and they also tell us a great deal about Hezbollah's organisation and structure, says Prof Khatib. Typically, the group operates with a high degree of secrecy, she says: “Not all its members are known, sometimes even to their own families.” What the attacks have done, then, is expose who paid members of Hezbollah actually were. That information, she says, has already proved useful to Israel.",
